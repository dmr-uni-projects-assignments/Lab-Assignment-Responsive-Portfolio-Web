## 📄 Notes

- I used ChatGPT to help me fix a CSS bug (although it didn't work and I ended up fixing it myself). Additionally, I used it to suggest CSS flags alongside VSCode autocomplete.
- I generated the color scheme using Coolors and modified it myself before designing in Canva.
- I wrote the project descriptions and contact section manually. The README file is taken from the template provided by my LAB class teacher.
